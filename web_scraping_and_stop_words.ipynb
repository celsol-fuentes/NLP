    "When web scraping text-based data, there is often content that needs to be cleaned or filtered out. One issue is how to deal with common words that do not provide much context or meaning to a text such as \"to\", \"me\", \"it\". These are known as stop words and the approach to filter these out often depends on the project requirements. Should just basic Python code do the job? Are default stop word lists in libraries enough? \n",

But else, not for the world.\\r\\nIn truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;\\r\\nAnd therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light:\\r\\nBut trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true\\r\\nThan those that have more cunning to be strange.\\r\\nI should have been more strange, I must confess,\\r\\nBut that thou overheard’st, ere I was ’ware,\\r\\nMy true-love passion; therefore pardon me,\\r\\nAnd not impute this yielding to light love,\\r\\nWhich the dark night hath so discovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nLady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,\\r\\nThat tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,—\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nO swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,\\r\\nThat monthly changes in her circled orb,\\r\\nLest that thy love prove likewise variable.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nWhat shall I swear by?\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nDo not swear at all.\\r\\nOr if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,\\r\\nWhich is the god of my idolatry,\\r\\nAnd I’ll believe thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nIf my heart’s dear love,—\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nWell, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,\\r\\nI have no joy of this contract tonight;\\r\\nIt is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,\\r\\nToo like the lightning, which doth cease to be\\r\\nEre one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night.\\r\\nThis bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,\\r\\nMay prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.\\r\\nGood night, good night. As sweet repose and rest\\r\\nCome to thy heart as that within my breast.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nO wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nWhat satisfaction canst thou have tonight?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nTh’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nI gave thee mine before thou didst request it;\\r\\nAnd yet I would it were to give again.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nWould’st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nBut to be frank and give it thee again.\\r\\nAnd yet I wish but for the thing I have;\\r\\nMy bounty is as boundless as the sea,\\r\\nMy love as deep; the more I give to thee,\\r\\nThe more I have, for both are infinite.\\r\\nI hear some noise within.

What a change is here!\\r\\nIs Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,\\r\\nSo soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies\\r\\nNot truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.\\r\\nJesu Maria, what a deal of brine\\r\\nHath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!\\r\\nHow much salt water thrown away in waste,\\r\\nTo season love, that of it doth not taste.\\r\\nThe sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,\\r\\nThy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears.\\r\\nLo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit\\r\\nOf an old tear that is not wash’d off yet.\\r\\nIf ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,\\r\\nThou and these woes were all for Rosaline,\\r\\nAnd art thou chang’d?

Came he not home tonight?\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nNot to his father’s; I spoke with his man.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nWhy, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so\\r\\nthat he will sure run mad.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nTybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a letter to his father’s\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nA challenge, on my life.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nRomeo will answer it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nAny man that can write may answer a letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nNay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares, being dared.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nAlas poor Romeo, he is already dead, stabbed with a white wench’s black\\r\\neye; run through the ear with a love song, the very pin of his heart\\r\\ncleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt-shaft. And is he a man to encounter\\r\\nTybalt?\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nWhy, what is Tybalt?\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nMore than Prince of cats. O, he’s the courageous captain of\\r\\ncompliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,\\r\\nand proportion. He rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in\\r\\nyour bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist;\\r\\na gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah,\\r\\nthe immortal passado, the punto reverso, the hay.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nThe what?\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nThe pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies; these new tuners\\r\\nof accent. By Jesu, a very good blade, a very tall man, a very good\\r\\nwhore. Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should\\r\\nbe thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers,\\r\\nthese pardon-me’s, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot\\r\\nsit at ease on the old bench? O their bones, their bones!\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nHere comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nWithout his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thou\\r\\nfishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura, to\\r\\nhis lady, was but a kitchen wench,—marry, she had a better love to\\r\\nberhyme her: Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gypsy; Helen and Hero hildings\\r\\nand harlots; Thisbe a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior\\r\\nRomeo, bonjour! There’s a French salutation to your French slop. You\\r\\ngave us the counterfeit fairly last night.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nGood morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nThe slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nPardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in such a case as\\r\\nmine a man may strain courtesy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nThat’s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow\\r\\nin the hams.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nMeaning, to curtsy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nThou hast most kindly hit it.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nA most courteous exposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nNay, I am the very pink of courtesy.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nPink for flower.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nRight.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nWhy, then is my pump well flowered.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nSure wit, follow me this jest now, till thou hast worn out thy pump,\\r\\nthat when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after the\\r\\nwearing, solely singular.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nO single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nCome between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nSwits and spurs, swits and spurs; or I’ll cry a match.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nNay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done. For thou hast\\r\\nmore of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than I am sure, I have in my\\r\\nwhole five. Was I with you there for the goose?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nThou wast never with me for anything, when thou wast not there for the\\r\\ngoose.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nI will bite thee by the ear for that jest.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nNay, good goose, bite not.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nThy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nAnd is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nO here’s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an\\r\\nell broad.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nI stretch it out for that word broad, which added to the goose, proves\\r\\nthee far and wide a broad goose.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nWhy, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou\\r\\nsociable, now art thou Romeo; not art thou what thou art, by art as\\r\\nwell as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a great natural,\\r\\nthat runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nStop there, stop there.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nThou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nThou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nO, thou art deceived; I would have made it short, for I was come to the\\r\\nwhole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no\\r\\nlonger.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Nurse and Peter.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nHere’s goodly gear!\\r\\nA sail, a sail!\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nTwo, two; a shirt and a smock.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nPeter!\\r\\n\\r\\nPETER.\\r\\nAnon.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nMy fan, Peter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nGood Peter, to hide her face; for her fan’s the fairer face.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nGod ye good morrow, gentlemen.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nGod ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nIs it good-den?\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\n’Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the\\r\\nprick of noon.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nOut upon you! What a man are you?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nOne, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nBy my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? Gentlemen,\\r\\ncan any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nI can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him\\r\\nthan he was when you sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for\\r\\nfault of a worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nYou say well.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nYea, is the worst well? Very well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nIf you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nShe will endite him to some supper.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nA bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nWhat hast thou found?\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nNo hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something\\r\\nstale and hoar ere it be spent.\\r\\n[_Sings._]\\r\\n    An old hare hoar,\\r\\n    And an old hare hoar,\\r\\n  Is very good meat in Lent;\\r\\n    But a hare that is hoar\\r\\n    Is too much for a score\\r\\n  When it hoars ere it be spent.\\r\\nRomeo, will you come to your father’s? We’ll to dinner thither.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nI will follow you.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nFarewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nI pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his\\r\\nropery?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nA gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak\\r\\nmore in a minute than he will stand to in a month.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nAnd a speak anything against me, I’ll take him down, and a were lustier\\r\\nthan he is, and twenty such Jacks. And if I cannot, I’ll find those\\r\\nthat shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of\\r\\nhis skains-mates.—And thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to\\r\\nuse me at his pleasure!\\r\\n\\r\\nPETER.\\r\\nI saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should\\r\\nquickly have been out. I warrant you, I dare draw as soon as another\\r\\nman, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nNow, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvy\\r\\nknave. Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bid me\\r\\nenquire you out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself. But first\\r\\nlet me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they\\r\\nsay, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the\\r\\ngentlewoman is young. And therefore, if you should deal double with\\r\\nher, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and\\r\\nvery weak dealing.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\\r\\nthee,—\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nGood heart, and i’faith I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she will\\r\\nbe a joyful woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nWhat wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nI will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a\\r\\ngentlemanlike offer.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nBid her devise\\r\\nSome means to come to shrift this afternoon,\\r\\nAnd there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell\\r\\nBe shriv’d and married. Here is for thy pains.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nNo truly, sir; not a penny.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nGo to; I say you shall.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nThis afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nAnd stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall.\\r\\nWithin this hour my man shall be with thee,\\r\\nAnd bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\\r\\nWhich to the high topgallant of my joy\\r\\nMust be my convoy in the secret night.\\r\\nFarewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;\\r\\nFarewell; commend me to thy mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nNow God in heaven bless thee. Hark you, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nWhat say’st thou, my dear Nurse?\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nIs your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,\\r\\nTwo may keep counsel, putting one away?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nI warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nWell, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! When ’twas a\\r\\nlittle prating thing,—O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that\\r\\nwould fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a\\r\\ntoad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her that\\r\\nParis is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she\\r\\nlooks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and\\r\\nRomeo begin both with a letter?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nAy, Nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nAh, mocker! That’s the dog’s name. R is for the—no, I know it begins\\r\\nwith some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,\\r\\nof you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nCommend me to thy lady.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nAy, a thousand times.

The sweetest honey\\r\\nIs loathsome in his own deliciousness,\\r\\nAnd in the taste confounds the appetite.\\r\\nTherefore love moderately: long love doth so;\\r\\nToo swift arrives as tardy as too slow.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere comes the lady. O, so light a foot\\r\\nWill ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.\\r\\nA lover may bestride the gossamers\\r\\nThat idles in the wanton summer air\\r\\nAnd yet not fall; so light is vanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nGood even to my ghostly confessor.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nRomeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nAs much to him, else is his thanks too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nAh, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\\r\\nBe heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more\\r\\nTo blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\\r\\nThis neighbour air, and let rich music’s tongue\\r\\nUnfold the imagin’d happiness that both\\r\\nReceive in either by this dear encounter.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nConceit more rich in matter than in words,\\r\\nBrags of his substance, not of ornament.\\r\\nThey are but beggars that can count their worth;\\r\\nBut my true love is grown to such excess,\\r\\nI cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nCome, come with me, and we will make short work,\\r\\nFor, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\\r\\nTill holy church incorporate two in one.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACT III\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE I.

Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a\\r\\nhair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel\\r\\nwith a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou\\r\\nhast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?\\r\\nThy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy\\r\\nhead hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast\\r\\nquarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath\\r\\nwakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall\\r\\nout with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with\\r\\nanother for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt\\r\\ntutor me from quarrelling!\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nAnd I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee\\r\\nsimple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nThe fee simple! O simple!\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Tybalt and others.\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nBy my head, here comes the Capulets.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nBy my heel, I care not.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nFollow me close, for I will speak to them.\\r\\nGentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nAnd but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a\\r\\nword and a blow.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nYou shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me\\r\\noccasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nCould you not take some occasion without giving?\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nMercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nConsort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of\\r\\nus, look to hear nothing but discords. Here’s my fiddlestick, here’s\\r\\nthat shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!\\r\\n\\r\\nBENVOLIO.\\r\\nWe talk here in the public haunt of men.\\r\\nEither withdraw unto some private place,\\r\\nAnd reason coldly of your grievances,\\r\\nOr else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nMen’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.\\r\\nI will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nWell, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nBut I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.\\r\\nMarry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;\\r\\nYour worship in that sense may call him man.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nRomeo, the love I bear thee can afford\\r\\nNo better term than this: Thou art a villain.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nTybalt, the reason that I have to love thee\\r\\nDoth much excuse the appertaining rage\\r\\nTo such a greeting. Villain am I none;\\r\\nTherefore farewell; I see thou know’st me not.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nBoy, this shall not excuse the injuries\\r\\nThat thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nI do protest I never injur’d thee,\\r\\nBut love thee better than thou canst devise\\r\\nTill thou shalt know the reason of my love.\\r\\nAnd so good Capulet, which name I tender\\r\\nAs dearly as mine own, be satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nO calm, dishonourable, vile submission!\\r\\n[_Draws._] Alla stoccata carries it away.\\r\\nTybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\nWhat wouldst thou have with me?\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nGood King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean to\\r\\nmake bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest\\r\\nof the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?\\r\\nMake haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYBALT.\\r\\n[_Drawing._] I am for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nGentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nCome, sir, your passado.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_They fight._]\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nDraw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.\\r\\nGentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage,\\r\\nTybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath\\r\\nForbid this bandying in Verona streets.\\r\\nHold, Tybalt!

Go villain, fetch a surgeon.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Page._]\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nCourage, man; the hurt cannot be much.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nNo, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but ’tis\\r\\nenough, ’twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a\\r\\ngrave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’ both\\r\\nyour houses. Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to\\r\\ndeath. A braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of\\r\\narithmetic!—Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your\\r\\narm.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nI thought all for the best.\\r\\n\\r\\nMERCUTIO.\\r\\nHelp me into some house, Benvolio,\\r\\nOr I shall faint.

Your houses!\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nThis gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,\\r\\nMy very friend, hath got his mortal hurt\\r\\nIn my behalf; my reputation stain’d\\r\\nWith Tybalt’s slander,—Tybalt, that an hour\\r\\nHath been my cousin.

All this uttered\\r\\nWith gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d\\r\\nCould not take truce with the unruly spleen\\r\\nOf Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts\\r\\nWith piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,\\r\\nWho, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,\\r\\nAnd, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats\\r\\nCold death aside, and with the other sends\\r\\nIt back to Tybalt, whose dexterity\\r\\nRetorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,\\r\\n‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,\\r\\nHis agile arm beats down their fatal points,\\r\\nAnd ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm\\r\\nAn envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\\r\\nOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.\\r\\nBut by and by comes back to Romeo,\\r\\nWho had but newly entertain’d revenge,\\r\\nAnd to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I\\r\\nCould draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;\\r\\nAnd as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.\\r\\nThis is the truth, or let Benvolio die.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY CAPULET.\\r\\nHe is a kinsman to the Montague.\\r\\nAffection makes him false, he speaks not true.\\r\\nSome twenty of them fought in this black strife,\\r\\nAnd all those twenty could but kill one life.\\r\\nI beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;\\r\\nRomeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nRomeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.\\r\\nWho now the price of his dear blood doth owe?\\r\\n\\r\\nMONTAGUE.\\r\\nNot Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;\\r\\nHis fault concludes but what the law should end,\\r\\nThe life of Tybalt.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nAnd for that offence\\r\\nImmediately we do exile him hence.\\r\\nI have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,\\r\\nMy blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.\\r\\nBut I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine\\r\\nThat you shall all repent the loss of mine.\\r\\nI will be deaf to pleading and excuses;\\r\\nNor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.\\r\\nTherefore use none.

They may seize\\r\\nOn the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,\\r\\nAnd steal immortal blessing from her lips,\\r\\nWho, even in pure and vestal modesty\\r\\nStill blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.\\r\\nBut Romeo may not, he is banished.\\r\\nThis may flies do, when I from this must fly.\\r\\nThey are free men but I am banished.\\r\\nAnd say’st thou yet that exile is not death?\\r\\nHadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,\\r\\nNo sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,\\r\\nBut banished to kill me? Banished?\\r\\nO Friar, the damned use that word in hell.\\r\\nHowlings attends it. How hast thou the heart,\\r\\nBeing a divine, a ghostly confessor,\\r\\nA sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,\\r\\nTo mangle me with that word banished?\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nThou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nO, thou wilt speak again of banishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nI’ll give thee armour to keep off that word,\\r\\nAdversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,\\r\\nTo comfort thee, though thou art banished.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nYet banished? Hang up philosophy.\\r\\nUnless philosophy can make a Juliet,\\r\\nDisplant a town, reverse a Prince’s doom,\\r\\nIt helps not, it prevails not, talk no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nO, then I see that mad men have no ears.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nHow should they, when that wise men have no eyes?\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nLet me dispute with thee of thy estate.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nThou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.\\r\\nWert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,\\r\\nAn hour but married, Tybalt murdered,\\r\\nDoting like me, and like me banished,\\r\\nThen mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,\\r\\nAnd fall upon the ground as I do now,\\r\\nTaking the measure of an unmade grave.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Knocking within._]\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nArise; one knocks.

O woeful sympathy!\\r\\nPiteous predicament. Even so lies she,\\r\\nBlubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.\\r\\nStand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man.\\r\\nFor Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.\\r\\nWhy should you fall into so deep an O?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nNurse.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nAh sir, ah sir, death’s the end of all.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nSpakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?\\r\\nDoth not she think me an old murderer,\\r\\nNow I have stain’d the childhood of our joy\\r\\nWith blood remov’d but little from her own?\\r\\nWhere is she? And how doth she? And what says\\r\\nMy conceal’d lady to our cancell’d love?\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nO, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;\\r\\nAnd now falls on her bed, and then starts up,\\r\\nAnd Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,\\r\\nAnd then down falls again.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nAs if that name,\\r\\nShot from the deadly level of a gun,\\r\\nDid murder her, as that name’s cursed hand\\r\\nMurder’d her kinsman.

Wilt thou slay thyself?\\r\\nAnd slay thy lady, that in thy life lives,\\r\\nBy doing damned hate upon thyself?\\r\\nWhy rail’st thou on thy birth, the heaven and earth?\\r\\nSince birth, and heaven and earth, all three do meet\\r\\nIn thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.\\r\\nFie, fie, thou sham’st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,\\r\\nWhich, like a usurer, abound’st in all,\\r\\nAnd usest none in that true use indeed\\r\\nWhich should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.\\r\\nThy noble shape is but a form of wax,\\r\\nDigressing from the valour of a man;\\r\\nThy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,\\r\\nKilling that love which thou hast vow’d to cherish;\\r\\nThy wit, that ornament to shape and love,\\r\\nMisshapen in the conduct of them both,\\r\\nLike powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,\\r\\nIs set afire by thine own ignorance,\\r\\nAnd thou dismember’d with thine own defence.\\r\\nWhat, rouse thee, man. Thy Juliet is alive,\\r\\nFor whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.\\r\\nThere art thou happy.

I think she will be rul’d\\r\\nIn all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.\\r\\nWife, go you to her ere you go to bed,\\r\\nAcquaint her here of my son Paris’ love,\\r\\nAnd bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next,\\r\\nBut, soft, what day is this?\\r\\n\\r\\nPARIS.\\r\\nMonday, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nCAPULET.\\r\\nMonday! Ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,\\r\\nA Thursday let it be; a Thursday, tell her,\\r\\nShe shall be married to this noble earl.\\r\\nWill you be ready? Do you like this haste?\\r\\nWe’ll keep no great ado,—a friend or two,\\r\\nFor, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,\\r\\nIt may be thought we held him carelessly,\\r\\nBeing our kinsman, if we revel much.\\r\\nTherefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,\\r\\nAnd there an end. But what say you to Thursday?\\r\\n\\r\\nPARIS.\\r\\nMy lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nCAPULET.\\r\\nWell, get you gone.

It is not yet near day.\\r\\nIt was the nightingale, and not the lark,\\r\\nThat pierc’d the fearful hollow of thine ear;\\r\\nNightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.\\r\\nBelieve me, love, it was the nightingale.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nIt was the lark, the herald of the morn,\\r\\nNo nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks\\r\\nDo lace the severing clouds in yonder east.\\r\\nNight’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day\\r\\nStands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.\\r\\nI must be gone and live, or stay and die.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nYond light is not daylight, I know it, I.\\r\\nIt is some meteor that the sun exhales\\r\\nTo be to thee this night a torchbearer\\r\\nAnd light thee on thy way to Mantua.\\r\\nTherefore stay yet, thou need’st not to be gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nLet me be ta’en, let me be put to death,\\r\\nI am content, so thou wilt have it so.\\r\\nI’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye,\\r\\n’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow.\\r\\nNor that is not the lark whose notes do beat\\r\\nThe vaulty heaven so high above our heads.\\r\\nI have more care to stay than will to go.\\r\\nCome, death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so.\\r\\nHow is’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not day.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nIt is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away.\\r\\nIt is the lark that sings so out of tune,\\r\\nStraining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.\\r\\nSome say the lark makes sweet division;\\r\\nThis doth not so, for she divideth us.\\r\\nSome say the lark and loathed toad change eyes.\\r\\nO, now I would they had chang’d voices too,\\r\\nSince arm from arm that voice doth us affray,\\r\\nHunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.\\r\\nO now be gone, more light and light it grows.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nMore light and light, more dark and dark our woes.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nMadam.\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nNurse?\\r\\n\\r\\nNURSE.\\r\\nYour lady mother is coming to your chamber.\\r\\nThe day is broke, be wary, look about.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nThen, window, let day in, and let life out.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nFarewell, farewell, one kiss, and I’ll descend.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Descends._]\\r\\n\\r\\nJULIET.\\r\\nArt thou gone so?

O mischief thou art swift\\r\\nTo enter in the thoughts of desperate men.\\r\\nI do remember an apothecary,—\\r\\nAnd hereabouts he dwells,—which late I noted\\r\\nIn tatter’d weeds, with overwhelming brows,\\r\\nCulling of simples, meagre were his looks,\\r\\nSharp misery had worn him to the bones;\\r\\nAnd in his needy shop a tortoise hung,\\r\\nAn alligator stuff’d, and other skins\\r\\nOf ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves\\r\\nA beggarly account of empty boxes,\\r\\nGreen earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,\\r\\nRemnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses\\r\\nWere thinly scatter’d, to make up a show.\\r\\nNoting this penury, to myself I said,\\r\\nAnd if a man did need a poison now,\\r\\nWhose sale is present death in Mantua,\\r\\nHere lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.\\r\\nO, this same thought did but forerun my need,\\r\\nAnd this same needy man must sell it me.\\r\\nAs I remember, this should be the house.\\r\\nBeing holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.\\r\\nWhat, ho! Apothecary!\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Apothecary.\\r\\n\\r\\nAPOTHECARY.\\r\\nWho calls so loud?\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nCome hither, man. I see that thou art poor.\\r\\nHold, there is forty ducats. Let me have\\r\\nA dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear\\r\\nAs will disperse itself through all the veins,\\r\\nThat the life-weary taker may fall dead,\\r\\nAnd that the trunk may be discharg’d of breath\\r\\nAs violently as hasty powder fir’d\\r\\nDoth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.\\r\\n\\r\\nAPOTHECARY.\\r\\nSuch mortal drugs I have, but Mantua’s law\\r\\nIs death to any he that utters them.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nArt thou so bare and full of wretchedness,\\r\\nAnd fear’st to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,\\r\\nNeed and oppression starveth in thine eyes,\\r\\nContempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.\\r\\nThe world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law;\\r\\nThe world affords no law to make thee rich;\\r\\nThen be not poor, but break it and take this.\\r\\n\\r\\nAPOTHECARY.\\r\\nMy poverty, but not my will consents.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nI pay thy poverty, and not thy will.\\r\\n\\r\\nAPOTHECARY.\\r\\nPut this in any liquid thing you will\\r\\nAnd drink it off; and, if you had the strength\\r\\nOf twenty men, it would despatch you straight.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nThere is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,\\r\\nDoing more murder in this loathsome world\\r\\nThan these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.\\r\\nI sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none.\\r\\nFarewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.\\r\\nCome, cordial and not poison, go with me\\r\\nTo Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II.

Therefore hence, be gone.\\r\\nBut if thou jealous dost return to pry\\r\\nIn what I further shall intend to do,\\r\\nBy heaven I will tear thee joint by joint,\\r\\nAnd strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.\\r\\nThe time and my intents are savage-wild;\\r\\nMore fierce and more inexorable far\\r\\nThan empty tigers or the roaring sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nBALTHASAR.\\r\\nI will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.\\r\\n\\r\\nROMEO.\\r\\nSo shalt thou show me friendship.

O, give me thy hand,\\r\\nOne writ with me in sour misfortune’s book.\\r\\nI’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.\\r\\nA grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth,\\r\\nFor here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes\\r\\nThis vault a feasting presence full of light.\\r\\nDeath, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Laying Paris in the monument._]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow oft when men are at the point of death\\r\\nHave they been merry!

O my love, my wife,\\r\\nDeath that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,\\r\\nHath had no power yet upon thy beauty.\\r\\nThou art not conquer’d. Beauty’s ensign yet\\r\\nIs crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,\\r\\nAnd death’s pale flag is not advanced there.\\r\\nTybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?\\r\\nO, what more favour can I do to thee\\r\\nThan with that hand that cut thy youth in twain\\r\\nTo sunder his that was thine enemy?\\r\\nForgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet,\\r\\nWhy art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe\\r\\nThat unsubstantial death is amorous;\\r\\nAnd that the lean abhorred monster keeps\\r\\nThee here in dark to be his paramour?\\r\\nFor fear of that I still will stay with thee,\\r\\nAnd never from this palace of dim night\\r\\nDepart again. Here, here will I remain\\r\\nWith worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here\\r\\nWill I set up my everlasting rest;\\r\\nAnd shake the yoke of inauspicious stars\\r\\nFrom this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last.\\r\\nArms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you\\r\\nThe doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\\r\\nA dateless bargain to engrossing death.\\r\\nCome, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide.\\r\\nThou desperate pilot, now at once run on\\r\\nThe dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark.\\r\\nHere’s to my love! [_Drinks._] O true apothecary!\\r\\nThy drugs are quick.

Meantime forbear,\\r\\nAnd let mischance be slave to patience.\\r\\nBring forth the parties of suspicion.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nI am the greatest, able to do least,\\r\\nYet most suspected, as the time and place\\r\\nDoth make against me, of this direful murder.\\r\\nAnd here I stand, both to impeach and purge\\r\\nMyself condemned and myself excus’d.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nThen say at once what thou dost know in this.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\r\\nI will be brief, for my short date of breath\\r\\nIs not so long as is a tedious tale.\\r\\nRomeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,\\r\\nAnd she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.\\r\\nI married them; and their stol’n marriage day\\r\\nWas Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death\\r\\nBanish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;\\r\\nFor whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.\\r\\nYou, to remove that siege of grief from her,\\r\\nBetroth’d, and would have married her perforce\\r\\nTo County Paris. Then comes she to me,\\r\\nAnd with wild looks, bid me devise some means\\r\\nTo rid her from this second marriage,\\r\\nOr in my cell there would she kill herself.\\r\\nThen gave I her, so tutored by my art,\\r\\nA sleeping potion, which so took effect\\r\\nAs I intended, for it wrought on her\\r\\nThe form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\\r\\nThat he should hither come as this dire night\\r\\nTo help to take her from her borrow’d grave,\\r\\nBeing the time the potion’s force should cease.\\r\\nBut he which bore my letter, Friar John,\\r\\nWas stay’d by accident; and yesternight\\r\\nReturn’d my letter back. Then all alone\\r\\nAt the prefixed hour of her waking\\r\\nCame I to take her from her kindred’s vault,\\r\\nMeaning to keep her closely at my cell\\r\\nTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.\\r\\nBut when I came, some minute ere the time\\r\\nOf her awaking, here untimely lay\\r\\nThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\\r\\nShe wakes; and I entreated her come forth\\r\\nAnd bear this work of heaven with patience.\\r\\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb;\\r\\nAnd she, too desperate, would not go with me,\\r\\nBut, as it seems, did violence on herself.\\r\\nAll this I know; and to the marriage\\r\\nHer Nurse is privy. And if ought in this\\r\\nMiscarried by my fault, let my old life\\r\\nBe sacrific’d, some hour before his time,\\r\\nUnto the rigour of severest law.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nWe still have known thee for a holy man.\\r\\nWhere’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?\\r\\n\\r\\nBALTHASAR.\\r\\nI brought my master news of Juliet’s death,\\r\\nAnd then in post he came from Mantua\\r\\nTo this same place, to this same monument.\\r\\nThis letter he early bid me give his father,\\r\\nAnd threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,\\r\\nIf I departed not, and left him there.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nGive me the letter, I will look on it.\\r\\nWhere is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?\\r\\nSirrah, what made your master in this place?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAGE.\\r\\nHe came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,\\r\\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\\r\\nAnon comes one with light to ope the tomb,\\r\\nAnd by and by my master drew on him,\\r\\nAnd then I ran away to call the watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nThis letter doth make good the Friar’s words,\\r\\nTheir course of love, the tidings of her death.\\r\\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison\\r\\nOf a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal\\r\\nCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\\r\\nWhere be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,\\r\\nSee what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\\r\\nThat heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\\r\\nAnd I, for winking at your discords too,\\r\\nHave lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.\\r\\n\\r\\nCAPULET.\\r\\nO brother Montague, give me thy hand.\\r\\nThis is my daughter’s jointure, for no more\\r\\nCan I demand.\\r\\n\\r\\nMONTAGUE.\\r\\nBut I can give thee more,\\r\\nFor I will raise her statue in pure gold,\\r\\nThat whiles Verona by that name is known,\\r\\nThere shall no figure at such rate be set\\r\\nAs that of true and faithful Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\nCAPULET.\\r\\nAs rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,\\r\\nPoor sacrifices of our enmity.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE.\\r\\nA glooming peace this morning with it brings;\\r\\nThe sun for sorrow will not show his head.\\r\\nGo hence, to have more talk of these sad things.\\r\\nSome shall be pardon’d, and some punished,\\r\\nFor never was a story of more woe\\r\\nThan this of Juliet and her Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]'"

mind the fairies coachmakers and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers brains and then they dream of love o er courtiers knees that dream on curtsies straight o er lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees o er ladies lips who straight on kisses dream which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are sometime she gallops o er a courtier s nose and then dreams he of smelling out a suit and sometime comes she with a tithe pig s tail tickling a parson s nose as a lies asleep then dreams he of another benefice sometime she driveth o er a soldier s neck and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats of breaches ambuscados spanish blades of healths five fathom deep and then anon drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again this is that very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night and bakes the elf locks in foul sluttish hairs which once

before warm and new kill d prince search seek and know how this foul murder comes first watch here is a friar and slaughter d romeo s man with instruments upon them fit to open these dead men s tombs capulet o heaven o wife look how our daughter bleeds this dagger hath mista en for lo his house is empty on the back of montague and it mis sheathed in my daughter s bosom lady capulet o me this sight

is dead tonight grief of my son s exile hath stopp d her breath what further woe conspires against mine age prince look and thou shalt see montague o thou untaught what manners is in this to press before thy father to a grave prince seal up the mouth of outrage for a while till we can clear these ambiguities and know their spring their head their true descent and then will i be general of your woes and lead you even to death meantime forbear and let mischance be slave to patience bring forth the parties of suspicion friar lawrence i am the greatest able to do least yet most suspected as the time and place doth make against me of this direful murder and here i stand both to impeach and purge myself condemned and myself excus d prince then say at once what thou dost know in this friar lawrence i will be brief for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale romeo there dead was husband to that juliet and she there dead that romeo s faithful wife i married them and their stol n marriage day was tybalt s doomsday whose untimely death banish d the new made bridegroom from this city for whom and not for tybalt juliet pin d you to remove that siege of grief from her betroth d and would have married her perforce to county paris then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some means to rid her from this second marriage or in my cell there would she kill herself then gave i her so tutored by my art a sleeping potion which so took effect as i intended for it wrought on her the form of death meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrow d grave being the time the potion s force should cease but he which bore my letter friar john was stay d by accident and yesternight return d my letter back then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindred s vault meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo but when i came some minute ere the time of her awaking here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead she wakes and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience but then a noise did scare me from the tomb and she too desperate would not go with me but as it seems did violence on herself all this i know and to the marriage her nurse is privy and if ought in this miscarried by my fault let my old life be sacrific d some hour before his time unto the rigour of severest law prince we still have known thee for a holy man where s romeo s man what can he say to this balthasar i brought my master news of juliet s death and then in post he came from mantua to this same place to this same monument this letter he early bid me give his father and threaten d me with death going in the vault if i departed not and left him there prince give me the letter i will look on it where is the county s page that rais d the watch sirrah what made your master in this place page he came with flowers to strew his lady s grave and bid me stand aloof and so i did anon comes one with light to ope the tomb and by and by my master drew on him and then i ran away to call the watch prince this letter doth make good the friar s words their course of love the tidings of her death and here he writes that he did buy a poison of a poor pothecary and therewithal came to this vault to die and lie with juliet where be these enemies capulet montague see what a scourge is laid upon your hate that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love and i for winking at your discords too have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punish d capulet o brother montague give me thy hand this is my daughter s jointure for no more can i demand montague but i can give thee more for i will raise her statue in pure gold that whiles verona by that name is known there shall no figure at such rate be set as that of true and faithful juliet capulet as rich shall romeo s by his lady s lie poor sacrifices of our enmity prince a glooming peace this morning with it brings the sun for sorrow will not show his head go hence to have more talk of these sad things some shall be pardon d and some punished for never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeo _exeunt _'"

mind the fairies coachmakers and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers brains and then they dream of love o er courtiers knees that dream on curtsies straight o er lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees o er ladies lips who straight on kisses dream which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are sometime she gallops o er a courtier s nose and then dreams he of smelling out a suit and sometime comes she with a tithe pig s tail tickling a parson s nose as a lies asleep then dreams he of another benefice sometime she driveth o er a soldier s neck and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats of breaches ambuscados spanish blades of healths five fathom deep and then anon drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again this is that very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night and bakes the elf locks in foul sluttish hairs which once

woes and lead you even to death meantime forbear and let mischance be slave to patience bring forth the parties of suspicion friar lawrence i am the greatest able to do least yet most suspected as the time and place doth make against me of this direful murder and here i stand both to impeach and purge myself condemned and myself excus d prince then say at once what thou dost know in this friar lawrence i will be brief for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale romeo there dead was husband to that juliet and she there dead that romeo s faithful wife i married them and their stol n marriage day was tybalt s doomsday whose untimely death banish d the new made bridegroom from this city for whom and not for tybalt juliet pin d you to remove that siege of grief from her betroth d and would have married her perforce to county paris then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some means to rid her from this second marriage or in my cell there would she kill herself then gave i her so tutored by my art a sleeping potion which so took effect as i intended for it wrought on her the form of death meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrow d grave being the time the potion s force should cease but he which bore my letter friar john was stay d by accident and yesternight return d my letter back then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindred s vault meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo but when i came some minute ere the time of her awaking here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead she wakes and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience but then a noise did scare me from the tomb and she too desperate would not go with me but as it seems did violence on herself all this i know and to the marriage her nurse is privy and if ought in this miscarried by my fault let my old life be sacrific d some hour before his time unto the rigour of severest law prince we still have known thee for a holy man where s romeo s man what can he say to this balthasar i brought my master news of juliet s death and then in post he came from mantua to this same place to this same monument this letter he early bid me give his father and threaten d me with death going in the vault if i departed not and left him there prince give me the letter i will look on it where is the county s page that rais d the watch sirrah what made your master in this place page he came with flowers to strew his lady s grave and bid me stand aloof and so i did anon comes one with light to ope the tomb and by and by my master drew on him and then i ran away to call the watch prince this letter doth make good the friar s words their course of love the tidings of her death and here he writes that he did buy a poison of a poor pothecary and therewithal came to this vault to die and lie with juliet where be these enemies capulet montague see what a scourge is laid upon your hate that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love and i for winking at your discords too have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punish d capulet o brother montague give me thy hand this is my daughter s jointure for no more can i demand montague but i can give thee more for i will raise her statue in pure gold that whiles verona by that name is known there shall no figure at such rate be set as that of true and faithful juliet capulet as rich shall romeo s by his lady s lie poor sacrifices of our enmity prince a glooming peace this morning with it brings the sun for sorrow will not show his head go hence to have more talk of these sad things some shall be pardon d and some punished for never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeo _exeunt _'"

    "## CONCLUSION\n",
    "\n",
    "For the play 'Romeo and Juliet', the Python method to remove stop words was surprising effective. The frequency plot did suggest the text concerned a tragic love story and it did give a sense of who were the main characters. It should be noted that for someone not familiar with the play, keeping character names (i.e. not turning them into stop words to be filtered out), could help determine the play's main characters. But when possible, it is preferable to use libraries to filter out stop words.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK was quite easy to use, and yielded similar results to the Python method. But there is no quick way to add stop words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spacy features allowing to add or remove default stop words is quite useful. It means these can be determined to reflect changing needs or project requirements. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'thou', 'thy', 'thee', 'hath', 'art', 'doth', 'tis'\n",
    "\n",
    "are just archaic or literary versions of the default stop words:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'you', 'your', 'you', 'has', 'are', 'does', 'it is'\n",
    "\n",
    "Not removing them shows the text has literary or archaic words, which could be useful to know. But this would come as no surprise to someone familiar with the play. Using SpaCy, those words could be added to the default stop words, and the frequency distribution would be even more filtered.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, web scraping text from Project Gutenberg was a fun way to practice filtering out stop words."
